#Paraxify v0.1

Simple parallax lightweight plugin (less than **2k gzipped**) built with Vanilla JS and CSS3 inspired by Spotify's. 

It's been thought as a progressive enhancing plugin, so don't expect it to work exactly the same on all browsers, but it does work in all of them, in one way or another.

I built this plugin because I couldn't find any other non-jquery plugins that fit my needs. 


#TODO

- Fix buggy behaviour on +IE9: The scrolling is not smooth.
- Try debouncing scroll event so it doesn't launch a bizillion times per second.
- Detect URL image changes and update `diff` accordingly.
- Clean up and make the code look pretty.
- Explain how it works on the README.
- Build a small demo site.
