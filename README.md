#Paraxify

Simple parallax effect built with Vanilla JS and CSS3 inspired by Spotify's. This is a progressive enhanced plugin, so don't expect it to work exactly the same on all browsers, but it does work in all of them, in one or another way.


#TODO

- Fix buggy behaviour on +IE9: The scrolling is not smooth.
- Try debouncing scroll event so it doesn't launch a bizillion times a second.
- Detect URL image changes and update `diff` accordingly.
